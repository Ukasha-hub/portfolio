I‚Äôm a quiet, introverted person, and a proud cat lady with a strong passion for software engineering. I love solving problems, have no issue staying focused on my work for hours, and have the patience needed to debug tricky code.
During university, I got pretty good at Python, Java, and some C. I also learned OOP, Data Structures, Algorithms, and other related courses. On top of that, I worked on a few website projects and picked up skills in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, a little PHP, and MySQL.
After graduation, I continued learning by joining an online course where I picked up ReactJS, NodeJS,  and MongoDB, and I completed some fun project assignments along the way.
I don‚Äôt have any industrial experience yet, but I‚Äôm excited to start working on real-world projects and show what I can doüòÅ.
