I‚Äôm a quiet, introverted person and a proud cat lady with a deep passion for software engineering. I love tackling complex problems, can stay focused on my work for hours, and have the patience to debug even the trickiest code.

During university, I built a solid foundation in Python, Java, and some C, along with strong knowledge of OOP, Data Structures, Algorithms, and related subjects. I also worked on several web projects, gaining hands-on experience with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.

After graduation, I continued to grow my skills by completing an online course in the MERN stack (ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB) and developed multiple project assignments that helped me sharpen my full-stack development abilities.

I also completed a Software Developer Internship, where I gained practical experience working on real-world projects, applying my technical skills in a collaborative environment, and enhancing my understanding of software development processes.

Now, I‚Äôm eager to take on new challenges, contribute to impactful projects, and continue learning and growing as a software engineer.üòÅ.
